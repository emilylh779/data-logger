# data-logger

Hi everyone,

I am using an Arduino Uno and Adafruit Data logging shield as a project to generate some temperature and humidity data.

The AHT20 is the sensor that is being used in the hot-house of the resident Leopard Gecko in the school Science deparment.

Due to Covid-19, this data is need to supplement A level Biology course as the Field trip is unable to take place
